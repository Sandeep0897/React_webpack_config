# React_webpack_config
This repo gives info about configuring react without CRA, as you all know, CRA is deprecated, now we have to use vite or webpack manually to setup react application. In this repo, i have configured React 18 with webpack 5. In coming weeks,  i will try to create MFA app with Single-spa.
